# AR Card Game
_As part of the final university course unit "Project" to create and manage an individual project, in which I selected the "Augmented Reality Card Game" project brief._

My aim was to create an unique card game that incorporates both the physical and digital world into its core gameplay, as opposed to simply using AR to enhance the immersion of an already existing game.

**Unveil** is a local turn-based 1v1 card game that takes place on a single mobile device. Using a standard deck of 52 playing cards (excluding Jokers), players are to draw and display 3 cards each and are to compete their hand's sum of values against each other. However, the physical values on the cards are fake and their corresponding true values can only be shown through AR. Using your wit, you are to decipher the true values of each player's hands and decide whether to take the fight to end the match or flee to delay the game onto the next round, drawing new hands.

Currently only works with my specific deck of cards, although admittedly the card detection is slightly unreliable - future consideration to create a deck of cards that can be printed out and played with, ensuring its design allows the card detection to work perfectly.

_Made in Unity using Vuforia._
